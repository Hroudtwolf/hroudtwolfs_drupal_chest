The Drupal admin interface allows you to delete up to 50 nodes and users and just one term at one time. But often it's just not enough.
What we need is, to bulk delete a multiple of nodes, terms and users.
"Mucky pup" is a removal tool for nodes, terms and users.
All removal processes are running per batch. So, it is perfect for removing of many, many content entries.

The tool comes with a new tab at "/admin/content" with the label "Content removal".
