--- DESCRIPTION ---

Provides a simple API for custom views access routines.
So, there is no need to implement an access-views-plugin for many purposes.

--- USAGE ---

1.) Enable the module.
2.) Add the Views Guard API access connector to the access section of your view.
3.) Implement the hook_viewsguard_api_access hook (See more in viewsguard_api.api.php).
